#Summary
From the data we can gather that male are the primary users of the bike sharing program and use them more consistently than the other two genders. The most usage of bikes also happened on Thursday as well as the most time used by riders from start point to endpoint. Even though we got good data from set and saw clear trends we cannot clearly form a analysis for De Moine to see if they are a good fit with the CitiBike program.
 In order to see if Citi Bikes is a good fit for De Moine, Iowa, the differences population and population growth between the two cities. This would help show for potential growth in the market. This can be done by using public Census data over the years and see what the trends show.
Another thing is more visuals would help investors see if CitiBike is a good fit including things like weather patterns and seeing if de moines has similar weather conditions to New York. To see if they can quell any narrative regarding notorious Midwest winters would stop bike riders. To help bring more investors confidence.
